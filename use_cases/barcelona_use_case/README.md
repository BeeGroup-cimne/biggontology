# Climate Ready Barcelona: Data ingestion and harmonisation to BIGG Ontology

This repository documents the data ingestion and harmonisation processes used in the Climate Ready Barcelona project. All datasets have been standardised and aligned with the BIGG Ontology, ensuring semantic interoperability and facilitating advanced queries, analysis, and integration across spatial and temporal dimensions.

The following links provide detailed information about the import tools and pre-processing workflows for each data source used in the project:
